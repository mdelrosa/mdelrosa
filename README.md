### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mason (he/him)! I am a PhD in applied machine learning. I'm currently looking for roles as a Data Scientist or a Machine Learning Engineer/Researcher.

Most of my GitHub activity for 2022-23 is visible at [@masondelro](https://github.com/masondelro).

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

- A set of [Python tutorials](https://github.com/mdelrosa/ml-explainability-fairness) on how to implement ML explainability/fairness methods from scratch.

### ðŸ‘€ Stuff I've worked on

#### ðŸ”Ž Ranking/recommendation model support in TruEra Diagnostics.

See the Colab notebook I wrote for this functionality here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/truera/truera-examples/blob/release/prod/starter-examples/starter-ranking.ipynb)
- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) (AI service, SDK)
- ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white) (Data ingestion, data querying (Trino/SQL))
- ![Jupyter Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/jupyter-%23FA0F00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=jupyter&logoColor=white) (demo notebook, debugging/prototyping)

#### ðŸ“± Efficient Deep Learning for Massive MIMO Channel State Estimation

My [doctoral dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/95c3a12f32f1124c5dc9cb08244f2aec/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y). Investigated techniques from statistical machine learning and deep learning to improve compressive CSI estimation in 5G networks.
- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) 	![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-%23FF6F00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=TensorFlow&logoColor=white) ![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-%23EE4C2C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white) (reproducing experiments; training/evaluating ML/DL models) 
- ![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/latex-%23008080.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=latex&logoColor=white) (typesetting; see here [mdelrosa/PhD_Thesis_MDR](https://github.com/mdelrosa/PhD_Thesis_MDR/tree/master))

#### ðŸ—£ LPC Vocoder

An implementation of a speech vocoder/synthesizer for a graduate course in Digital Signal Processing. Check it out [here (mdelrosa/eec201_final_project)](https://github.com/mdelrosa/eec201_final_project).
- ![Octave](https://img.shields.io/badge/OCTAVE-darkblue?style=for-the-badge&logo=octave&logoColor=fcd683) (vocoder implementation)
- ![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/latex-%23008080.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=latex&logoColor=white) (typesetting report)
