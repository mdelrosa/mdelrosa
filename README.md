### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mason (he/him)! I am a PhD in applied machine learning. I'm currently looking for roles as a Data Scientist or a Machine Learning Engineer/Researcher.

Most of my GitHub activity for 2022-23 is visible at [@masondelro](https://github.com/masondelro).

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

- A set of [Python tutorials](https://github.com/mdelrosa/ml-explainability-fairness) on how to implement ML explainability/fairness methods from scratch.

### ðŸ‘€ Stuff I've worked on

- **Added ranking/recommendation model support to the TruEra Diagnostics product.** See the Colab notebook I wrote for this functionality here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/truera/truera-examples/blob/release/prod/starter-examples/starter-ranking.ipynb)
